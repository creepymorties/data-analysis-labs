Labs for High-dimentional Data Analysis


My implementation seem to not work properly and I've tried multiple ways to put formulas together. 
I ended up with probably incorrect but somehow working implementation (Gradient descent does not decrease with steps)
All other attempts would not converge at all.

I also added formulas for MSPE, being aware that my implementation is not following them correctly.
